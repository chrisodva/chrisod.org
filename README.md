  <h1>Sales Leadership for Web Development Agencies</h1> 
  
<h2>You</h2> <p>You are a web design and development agency or related service delivering solutions on open source platforms such as WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla. You would like to grow sales, particularly in the public sector. You could be looking for a full time employee, or a fractional relationship.</p> 
  
<h2>Me</h2> <p>I'm a deeply experienced sales executive in the web design world. I sold my first six figure website project in 1996. Over the last ten years I've averaged about $1.5 million in annual sales, primarily using the Drupal CMS. There is a million dollar WordPress deal in there too. I've mostly worked as the primary sales executive for 20-40 person agencies that build on Drupal and WordPress. </p> 

<h2>Match?</h2> <p>If you have read enough and want to chat, <a href="mailto:chris@chrisod.org?subject=website inquiry">send me an email</a> and I'll get back to you ASAP to schedule a time to talk.</p>

<ul> <li> I led an 18 month effort to win the redesign of the <a href="https://gao.gov"> General Accountability Office </a>for the Federal Government. It was a million dollar development effort, plus FedRamp hosting. I partnered with a prime contractor that had the contract vehicles to facilitate the contract award.</li> 
  
<li> I won the redesign of the <a href="https://flydenver.com"> the Denver Airport website.</a> It was a Drupal 7 site that we redesigned and migrated to WordPress. It had a million dollar budget over 5 years (design, development, hosting, support).</li> 

<li>I won the redesign of the <a href="https://ocgov.com">Orange County, CA website.</a> It was on a proprietary platform and we migrated it to 50+ site Drupal multisite as part of the redesign. It was close to a million dollar project.</li> 

<li>I also wrote the proposal and led the presentations that resulted in over $500K of work to redesign two websites for Southern Illinois University. The sites are <a href="https://www.siumed.edu/">SIU Medical School</a> and <a href="https://www.siumed.org">SIU Healthcare.</a></li> 

<li>In the commercial world, I grew a $3000 audit of a marketing subsite for Lenovo into $400K annual billings to redesign the site in Drupal 8+ and support it with a team of 6 offshore developers.</li> </ul>
