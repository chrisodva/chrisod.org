  <h1>Sales Leadership for Web Development Agencies</h1> 
  
<h2>You</h2> <p>You need somebody to run sales and/or proposals. You've outgrown the "Founder does it all" stage but aren't quite to the sales department of 10 stage either. You need somebody that can do it all, even if the specific job function isn't going to require an all-in-one solution.</p> 
  
<h2>Me</h2> <p>For most of the previous 12 years, I’ve been the sales and proposal department for 20-50 person web consulting firms. I’ve been a full-stack sales resource responsible for lead generation, bid/no-bid decisions, win theme development, proposal development, proposal delivery, short list presentations, and ultimately closing the deal before handing it off to the production team. I’ve done this primarily for Drupal focused agencies, but the skills are transferrable to a variety of environments.

<ul> <li> I led an 18 month effort to win the redesign of the <a href="https://gao.gov"> General Accountability Office </a>for the Federal Government. It was a million dollar development effort, plus FedRamp hosting. I partnered with a prime contractor that had the contract vehicles to facilitate the contract award.</li> 
  
<li> I won the redesign of the <a href="https://flydenver.com"> the Denver Airport website.</a> It was a Drupal 7 site that we redesigned and migrated to WordPress. It had a million dollar budget over 5 years (design, development, hosting, support).</li> 

<li>I won the redesign of the <a href="https://ocgov.com">Orange County, CA website.</a> It was on a proprietary platform and we migrated it to 50+ site Drupal multisite as part of the redesign. It was close to a million dollar project.</li> 

<li>I also wrote the proposal and led the presentations that resulted in over $500K of work to redesign two websites for Southern Illinois University. The sites are <a href="https://www.siumed.edu/">SIU Medical School</a> and <a href="https://www.siumed.org">SIU Healthcare.</a></li> 

<li>In the commercial world, I grew a $3000 audit of a marketing subsite for Lenovo into $400K annual billings to redesign the site in Drupal 8+ and support it with a team of 6 offshore developers.</li> </ul>
